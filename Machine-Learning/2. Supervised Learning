Supervised learning is aplicable when the sample data that is input as well as output data is given 
Data with a correct label
In supervised learning first the model is trained and then test on the test dataset 

Example: we have a dataset tagged as "CAT" a machine learning algorithm trained with this dog images so it can easily distuinguish wheather an image is dog or not.


Understand in depth:

suppose we have a dataset of different types of shapes which includes square, rectangle, trainagle
First step is we need to train a model 
- if given shape has 4 sides and all sides are equal then it is labelled as Square
- if given shapes has 3 sides then it is labelled as triangle

* steps involved in supervised Learning

1. Determine the type of dataset
2. Gather the data
3. Split the data into Training, testing and validation
4. Feature selection ( which should have enough knowledge so that model can predict acurately)
5. Determine the suitable algorithm 
6. Execute algorithm 
7. Evaluate accuracy.
