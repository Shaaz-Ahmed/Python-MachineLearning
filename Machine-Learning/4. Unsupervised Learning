As a named unsupervised learning - in unsupervised machine learning in whihc model are not supervised using training data

In unsupervised learning model itself find the hidden patters, insights from the given data

example: suppose unsupervised learning algorithm os given an input dataset containing upon the given dataset which mean it does not have any idea baout feature of the dataset
the task of unsupervised is to identify the image feature on their own and give output

in unsupervised learning the training can done using finding the patterns , insight from given data by their own 

Unsupervised learning algorithm find the patterns and insigth from the given data and then it identify the image feature by their own 


Unsupervisde learning is similar to human brain 
unsupervised learning data is helpful for fidnignuseful insgiht from the data 


* Types of unsupervised
1. Clustering 
2. Association


Unsupervised
