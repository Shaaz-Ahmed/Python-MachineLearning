Dimensionaltiy reduction :
It is a process of reducing the number of input variable (feature) in a dataset while keeping as much relevant information as possible

It helps make model faster ,less complex, and ofthen more accurate

Image we have a dataset with lot of column (feature) but from that all are not useful for the prediction or recommendation so we will remove some 
column from it . so this is called the dimensionality reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a technique aim to keep any most import column and remove one's that dont contribute for prediction


* There are two ways for the dimensionality reduction
1. Feature selection: 
Feature selection means we will only choose the column which is more important which is more useful for prediction

2. Feature extraction:
