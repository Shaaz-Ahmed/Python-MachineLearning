5. Polynomial Regression


# Classification:
Classification is used when you have the output variable is cateogrical which mean there are two classes such as YES,NO or TRUE FALSE.

Algorithm comes under classification
1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Machine
